# Practice Problem Basic Functions

The objective of this first practice problem is to get used to the testing suite interface, and to begin to develop the skills of breaking down problems so that they can be solved. This ability to break down problems into small solvable pieces is a skill that can only be developed with practice, as you literally have to create new neuro-pathways in the brain. But don't worry, this problem and the ones which follow are designed to help you do just that.

Take your time as you go through this initial collection of functions, as it is important to understand how the testing suite will work, and how to take feedback from it into consideration when solving problems.

With that introduction in mind, let's get started!

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise
For this exercise you will be constructing several generic string concatenation and calculation functions. You are given a description of each function, a suite of unit tests for each function, and an empty JavaScript file in which to write your implementation for each function.

Your goal is to define each function according to its description, such that all of its tests pass.

Begin by skimming through `index.html` in your code editor, then opening it in your web browser. You should see **`ReferenceError: ... is not defined`** a few times on the page.



Open `src/string-1.js` and `src/string-1.test.js` in your code editor and skim the code in `string-1.test.js`. As you add to or modify `string-1.js`, reload `index.html` in your browser to receive feedback. Work through defining each function specified below until all unit tests pass.

1. ### `returnString(string)`

    #### Parameters

      - `string` - Any JavaScript `string`

    #### Return Value

    returnString("howdy")     // -> "howdy"
    ```

2. ### `favoriteFood(food)`
